# React Firebase CRUD Project

This is a small React.js project that integrates with Firebase Realtime Database to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project features:

- **Firebase Realtime Database Integration**: Connects to Firebase for storing and retrieving data in real-time.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete entries from Firebase.
- **Routing**: Utilizes React Router for navigation between components.
- **Data Display**: Data is fetched from Firebase and displayed dynamically in React components.
- **Update and Delete**: Enables users to update or delete specific entries from the database.

This project demonstrates the core principles of working with Firebase and React to build a dynamic, real-time web application.
